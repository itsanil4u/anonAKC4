Using Aliases (AS) - exercise
This will be a slightly more sophisticated task.

Write a query that obtains two columns. The first column must contain annual salaries higher than 80,000 dollars. The second column, renamed to “emps_with_same_salary”, must show the number of employees contracted to that salary. Lastly, sort the output by the first column.
